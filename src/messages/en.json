    "description": "Answering key questions about corporate fleet outsourcing.",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Is outsourcing cheaper than maintaining your own fleet?",
      "answer": "Yes, clients typically save 20-30% by eliminating hidden fleet ownership costs such as unexpected maintenance, insurance premiums, administrative overhead, and depreciation. We leverage economies of scale to provide better rates."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How quickly can we launch the service?",
      "answer": "We can typically mobilize a fleet within 14 days for standard requirements. For complex large-scale operations using specialized vehicles, we provide a detailed transition plan, typically taking 4-6 weeks to ensure no disruptions."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What happens in case of an accident or breakdown?",
      "answer": "We handle everything. Our 24/7 dispatch center immediately dispatches a replacement vehicle so your schedule isn't affected. We handle all reports, insurance claims, and repairs."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is there a trial period?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer a pilot project format. This allows you to evaluate our service quality, safety level, and driver professionalism in practice before launching full-scale cooperation."
